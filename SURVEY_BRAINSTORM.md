# Lake Schools Family Survey - Brainstorm Document

## Purpose

This document outlines a proposed survey to gather **actionable data** about family intentions if the lake schools (Zephyr Cove Elementary and George Whittell High School) were to close. The goal is to provide the school board with realistic projections for planning purposes.

**Important:** This survey should be designed to capture genuine intentions, not advocacy positions. Accurate data—even if unfavorable—serves everyone's interests better than inflated or deflated estimates.

---

## Survey Design Principles

1. **Neutral framing** - Avoid leading questions that push respondents toward a particular answer
2. **Realistic context** - Provide honest information about what consolidation would entail
3. **Actionable specificity** - Ask questions that yield data useful for planning
4. **Capture uncertainty** - Allow respondents to express genuine uncertainty
5. **Identify decision factors** - Understand what would influence family choices

## Proposed Preamble

> ### Lake Schools Consolidation Planning Survey
>
> The Douglas County School District is gathering information to understand how families would respond if Zephyr Cove Elementary School and George Whittell High School were consolidated with valley schools in the Gardnerville/Minden area.
>
> **Please answer based on what your family would actually do, not what you hope will happen.** Accurate information—even if it reflects difficult choices—helps the district plan responsibly.
>
> #### What Consolidation Would Mean
>
> If the lake schools were to close, students would have several options:
>
> **Option A: Transfer to Douglas County valley schools**
> - Elementary students would attend a Gardnerville/Minden area elementary school
> - High school students would attend Douglas High School
> - Bus transportation would be provided by the district
> - Estimated one-way travel time: 45-70 minutes depending on route and conditions
> - Winter weather (snow, ice on Kingsbury Grade) may cause delays or cancellations
> - After-school activities would require additional transportation arrangements
>
> **Option B: Transfer to South Lake Tahoe schools (California)**
> - Requires establishing California residency or paying tuition
> - Shorter commute for many lake area families
> - Different state curriculum and graduation requirements
>
> **Option C: Homeschool or online learning**
> - Nevada has homeschool notification requirements
> - Douglas Nevada Online is available for some grade levels
>
> **Option D: Private school**
> - Limited options in the immediate area
> - Tuition costs would apply
>
> **Option E: Relocate**
> - Some families may choose to move closer to their preferred school
>
> Your responses will help the district understand the realistic impacts of consolidation and plan accordingly.

## Survey Administration Notes

### Recommended Approach

1. **Household-based, not anonymous**
   - Need to count actual students, not just opinions
   - Confidential (not shared publicly) but attributable for planning
   - One response per household

2. **Verification suggested**
   - Cross-reference with enrollment records
   - Ensures responses represent actual enrolled families

3. **Timeline**
   - Allow 2-3 weeks for response
   - Send reminders to non-respondents
   - Follow up with phone calls if needed for complete data

4. **Presentation of results**
   - Report by student count, not household count
   - Include confidence levels in projections
   - Clearly separate "definite" from "uncertain" responses

### Analysis Framework

| Response Category | Planning Assumption |
|-------------------|---------------------|
| "Definitely transfer to valley" + "Very confident" | Count as retained |
| "Probably transfer to valley" + "Somewhat confident" | Count 50% as retained |
| "Genuinely unsure" | Model as range (25-75% retained) |
| Any other primary response | Count as lost to district |

## Alternative Question Framings

### For Q5 (Primary Intention) - More Detailed Version

> **If the lake schools were to close, please rank your likely options from 1 (most likely) to 5 (least likely):**
>
> ___ Transfer to Douglas County valley schools with bus transportation
> ___ Transfer to South Lake Tahoe schools (California)
> ___ Homeschool or enroll in online school
> ___ Enroll in private school
> ___ Relocate to another area

### For Q5 - Forced Choice Version

> **If you had to choose TODAY and the lake schools were closing, which would you choose?**
>
> (This removes the "unsure" option to force a directional response, but may reduce accuracy)

### For Capturing Intensity

> **How strongly do you feel about your selected choice?**
> - [ ] This is the only acceptable option for our family
> - [ ] This is our strong preference but we could consider alternatives
> - [ ] This is our slight preference among roughly equal options
> - [ ] We genuinely don't have a preference yet

## Questions to Avoid (Leading or Biased)

These question framings should be avoided as they may bias responses:

| Problematic Framing | Why It's Problematic |
|---------------------|----------------------|
| "Would you subject your child to a 2-hour daily commute?" | Emotionally loaded ("subject") |
| "Would you abandon your community school?" | Implies moral judgment ("abandon") |
| "Do you support keeping our schools open?" | Measures opinion, not behavior |
| "Given the dangerous mountain roads..." | Assumes conclusion ("dangerous") |
| "Would you trust your child's safety on winter buses?" | Fear-based framing |

---

## Potential Stratification

Consider analyzing results separately by:

- **Grade level** (elementary vs. high school families may differ)
- **Tenure in area** (newer vs. established families)
- **Distance from potential bus routes**
- **Single-child vs. multi-child households**
- **Homeowners vs. renters** (mobility proxy)

---

## Notes for Survey Committee

1. **Pilot test** the survey with 5-10 families before full distribution to catch confusing questions

2. **Spanish translation** may be needed depending on community demographics

3. **Paper option** should be available for families without reliable internet

4. **Consider timing** - surveying during school year vs. summer may yield different responses

5. **Communicate purpose clearly** - families should understand this is for planning, not a vote

6. **Share methodology** - transparency about how responses will be used builds trust

---

## Expected Outcomes

A well-designed survey should provide:

1. **Point estimate**: "X% of current students would likely transfer to valley schools"
2. **Confidence range**: "Between X% and Y% depending on uncertain responses"
3. **Conditional insights**: "Z% would transfer IF [specific condition] were met"
4. **Qualitative themes**: Common concerns and values from open responses

This data enables scenario planning with realistic assumptions rather than best-case or worst-case guesses.
