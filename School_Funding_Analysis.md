# Douglas County Schools: Funding Contribution Analysis

## Data Availability Note

**Important:** The PCFP (Pupil-Centered Funding Plan) model contains **revenue/funding allocation data only**. It does not include school-level operating expenses (salaries, utilities, maintenance, etc.).

### What We CAN Calculate
- State funding allocated to each school/attendance area
- Per-pupil funding rates
- Relative funding contribution by school

### What We CANNOT Calculate (Without Additional Data)
- School-level operating costs
- Net contribution (revenue minus expenses)
- True cost-per-pupil by school

### Data Needed for Complete Analysis
To determine if schools are "net positive" to the district budget, we would need:
- School-level salary and benefits costs
- Facility operating costs by building
- Transportation costs by route
- Administrative overhead allocation
- Special program costs

## Part 2: Lake Schools Funding Analysis

### Key Finding: Lake Schools Punch Above Their Weight

| Metric | Lake Schools | District Total | Lake Schools % |
|--------|--------------|----------------|----------------|
| Enrollment | 273 | 4,791 | **5.7%** |
| Total Funding | $4,692,644 | $50,969,716 | **9.2%** |
| Size Adjustment | $2,119,890 | $5,784,909 | **36.6%** |

**The lake schools represent 5.7% of enrollment but bring in 9.2% of state funding.**

This "overperformance" is due to the District Size Adjustment, which intentionally provides higher per-pupil funding for small, isolated schools.

## Part 3: Net Contribution Framework

### The Question: Are Lake Schools "Net Positive"?

To answer this, we need to compare:
- **Revenue**: What funding does the school bring to the district?
- **Expenses**: What does it cost to operate the school?
- **Net**: Revenue minus Expenses

### What We Know (Revenue Side)

| Component | Lake Schools | Notes |
|-----------|--------------|-------|
| Base Per-Pupil | $2,572,754 | 272.8 × $9,432 |
| Size Adjustment | $2,119,890 | Small school formula |
| **Total State Funding** | **$4,692,644** | Directly attributable |
| Weighted Funding (EL, At-Risk)* | ~$50,000 | Estimated share |
| Transportation* | ~$227,000 | Estimated share (~5.7%) |
| Special Education* | ~$242,000 | Estimated share (~5.7%) |
| **TOTAL ESTIMATED REVENUE** | **~$5,200,000** | |

*District-level allocations; school share estimated proportionally

### What We'd Need to Know (Expense Side)

| Expense Category | Estimated Range | Notes |
|------------------|-----------------|-------|
| Certified Staff (Teachers) | $1.5M - $2.5M | Depends on staffing ratios |
| Classified Staff | $300K - $500K | Aides, secretaries, custodians |
| Administration | $200K - $400K | Principal, assistant principal |
| Utilities | $100K - $200K | Heating significant at elevation |
| Maintenance | $100K - $200K | Building upkeep |
| Supplies & Materials | $50K - $100K | |
| **ESTIMATED EXPENSE RANGE** | **$2.3M - $3.9M** | Per school |
| **BOTH SCHOOLS** | **$4.6M - $7.8M** | Combined |

### Rough Net Contribution Scenarios

| Scenario | Revenue | Expenses | Net |
|----------|---------|----------|-----|
| Efficient Operations | $5.2M | $4.6M | **+$600K** (net positive) |
| Average Operations | $5.2M | $5.5M | **-$300K** (slight negative) |
| High-Cost Operations | $5.2M | $7.0M | **-$1.8M** (net negative) |

**Key Insight:** Whether lake schools are net positive or negative depends entirely on actual operating costs, which we don't have.

---

## Part 4: The Closure Fallacy

### Common Misconception

> "If schools are net negative, we should close them to save money."

This reasoning has a critical flaw: **closure doesn't capture the revenue, it loses it.**

### The Math

**If lake schools are operating at break-even ($5.2M revenue, $5.2M expenses):**

| Action | Revenue Change | Expense Change | Net Impact |
|--------|----------------|----------------|------------|
| Continue operating | $0 | $0 | $0 |
| Close schools (100% transfer) | -$1.9M | -$5.2M | +$3.3M savings |
| Close schools (50% transfer) | -$3.3M | -$5.2M | +$1.9M savings |
| Close schools (10% transfer) | -$4.4M | -$5.2M | +$0.8M savings |

**If lake schools are net negative by $500K/year:**

| Action | Revenue Change | Expense Change | Net Impact |
|--------|----------------|----------------|------------|
| Continue operating | $0 | $0 | -$500K/year |
| Close schools (100% transfer) | -$1.9M | -$5.7M | +$3.8M - $500K = +$3.3M |
| Close schools (10% transfer) | -$4.4M | -$5.7M | +$1.3M - $500K = +$0.8M |

### The Hidden Costs of Closure

Even "savings" scenarios ignore:

1. **Stranded facility costs** - Buildings still need maintenance, insurance
2. **Transition costs** - One-time expenses for student transfers
3. **Transportation increases** - Longer bus routes cost more
4. **Capacity investments** - Receiving schools may need expansion
5. **Enrollment flight** - Students leaving district entirely

---

## Part 5: Request for Expense Data

### To Complete This Analysis, We Need:

1. **School-level budget reports** for Zephyr Cove Elementary and George Whittell High School
   - Staff FTE counts and salary totals
   - Operating expenses by category
   - Allocated district overhead

2. **Comparative data** for similar-sized schools in the district
   - ASPIRE Academy (74 students)
   - Jacobsen High School (22 students)

3. **Transportation cost breakdown**
   - Current lake schools routes cost
   - Projected cost for valley school transport

4. **Facility assessments**
   - Building condition and maintenance needs
   - Utilities cost per square foot
   - Disposition options if closed

### Questions for District Finance Office

1. What is the total operating budget for each lake school?
2. How are district overhead costs allocated to schools?
3. What are the actual transportation costs for lake school routes?
4. Are there any capital expenditure needs for these facilities?

---

## Part 6: Preliminary Conclusions

### What We Know for Certain

1. **Lake schools bring $4.7M in state funding annually** - This is documented in the PCFP model

2. **Lake schools receive 69% more per-pupil funding than valley schools** - $17,204 vs $10,177, due to small school adjustment

3. **Closure would lose $1.9M - $4.4M annually** - Depending on student retention rates

4. **Lake schools represent 36.6% of district's Size Adjustment funding** - While serving only 5.7% of students

### What We Don't Know

1. Actual operating costs for lake schools
2. Whether they are net positive or negative on current operations
3. Full cost comparison with closure alternatives

### Recommendation

Before any consolidation decision, the district should:

1. **Produce school-level expense reports** - Actual costs, not estimates
2. **Model full closure scenarios** - Including hidden costs
3. **Survey families for realistic retention estimates** - See SURVEY_BRAINSTORM.md
4. **Compare to similar small schools** - Are lake schools unusually expensive?

## Appendix: Funding Formula Reference

### Statewide Base Per-Pupil: $9,432

### District Size Adjustment Formula

For attendance areas with 18-3,899 students:
```
Adjustment Factor = (-0.281 × ln(enrollment)) + 3.4
Per-Pupil Adjustment = Adjustment Factor × Base Amount × (factor - 1)
```

### Douglas County Size Adjustments

| Attendance Area | Enrollment | Per-Pupil Adj. | Total Adjustment |
|-----------------|------------|----------------|------------------|
| Gardnerville/Minden | 4,496 | $745 | $3,350,112 |
| Zephyr Cove | 273 | $7,772 | $2,119,889 |
| Jacobsen | 22 | $14,474 | $314,915 |
