# Analysis of DCSD School Consolidation Scenarios
## Board Meeting - January 7, 2026

This document provides an independent analysis of the "School Consolidation Scenarios and Cost Savings Analysis" presented at the DCSD Special Board Meeting on 1/7/2026.

---

## Executive Summary

**The district's presentation shows only cost savings and omits the critical revenue impact of closing lake schools.**

- Lake school consolidation shows **$251,673 in savings**
- However, lake schools generate a **net surplus of $809,000 - $1.2M** for the district
- If families leave (70-90% per community surveys), the district risks losing **$2M+ in state funding**
- The valley consolidation scenarios (North/South) each save **4x more** than the lake scenario

## The Three Consolidation Scenarios Presented

| Scenario | Schools | Staff Savings | Utility Savings | Total Savings |
|----------|---------|---------------|-----------------|---------------|
| **North** | Jacks Valley + Pinon Hills | $938,762 | $80,580 | **$1,019,342** |
| **South** | Scarselli + C.C. Meneley | $938,762 | $68,100 | **$1,006,862** |
| **Lake** | Zephyr Cove + Whittell | $188,013 | $63,660 | **$251,673** |

**Observation:** The lake consolidation saves significantly less than valley consolidations because lake schools are already operating with minimal staff.

## What the Slides Don't Show: Revenue Impact

### Nevada's Pupil-Centered Funding Plan (PCFP)

Under Nevada's funding model, schools receive:
1. **Statewide Base Per Pupil Amount:** $9,432 per student
2. **District Size Adjustment (Attendance Area Funding):** Additional funding for small/rural schools

### Douglas County Attendance Area Funding (from PCFP Model 2025-2027)

| Attendance Area | Enrollment | Size Adj/Pupil | Total Size Adj |
|-----------------|------------|----------------|----------------|
| Gardnerville/Minden | 4,496 | $745 | $3,350,112 |
| **Zephyr Cove (Lake)** | 273 | **$7,772** | **$2,119,889** |
| Jacobsen | 22 | $14,474 | $314,915 |
| **Douglas Total** | 4,791 | $1,208 avg | $5,784,916 |

**Key Finding:** Lake school students bring in **$7,772/pupil** in size adjustment - more than **10x** the valley rate of $745/pupil.

## Lake Schools: Full Financial Picture

### Revenue (Funding IN)

| Source | Per Pupil | Total (273 students) |
|--------|-----------|----------------------|
| Statewide Base | $9,432 | $2,573,928 |
| Size Adjustment | $7,772 | $2,119,889 |
| **Subtotal** | **$17,204** | **$4,693,817** |
| Auxiliary (Transportation) | $830 | $226,399 |
| Weighted (SpEd, ELL, G&T) | ~$410K est. | ~$409,511 |
| **Total Funding** | **~$18,705** | **~$5,102,167** |

### Expenditures (Costs OUT)

Per DCSD's "2024-2025 State Funded Expenditure by Site" report:

| School | Per Pupil Cost | Total Cost |
|--------|----------------|------------|
| George Whittell High School | $16,247 | $2,240,947 |
| Zephyr Cove Elementary | $10,361 | $1,642,519 |
| **Total Lake Schools** | | **$3,883,466** |

### Net Contribution

| Calculation | Amount |
|-------------|--------|
| Total Funding | $4,692,656 - $5,102,167 |
| Total Costs | $3,883,466 |
| **Net Surplus** | **$809,190 - $1,218,701** |

**Lake schools are budget-positive.** They contribute $809K-$1.2M MORE to the district than they cost to operate.

---

## The Real Risk: Funding Loss if Families Leave

Community surveys indicate **70-90% of lake families would leave the district** if either school closes.

### Scenario: 80% of Lake Students Leave District

| Impact | Amount |
|--------|--------|
| Students Lost | 218 |
| Base Funding Lost | $2,056,176 |
| Size Adjustment Lost | $1,694,296 |
| **Total Funding Lost** | **$3,750,472** |

### Net Impact Comparison

| Scenario | Savings per Slides | Funding at Risk | **Net Impact** |
|----------|-------------------|-----------------|----------------|
| Lake Consolidation | +$251,673 | -$3,750,472 | **-$3.5M** |

Even if only 50% of families leave, the district loses ~$1.9M in funding while "saving" only $252K.

## Staff Reduction Comparison

### Lake Schools (Page 16 of Slides)

| Position | Current FTE | Proposed FTE | Change |
|----------|-------------|--------------|--------|
| Principal | 1 | 1 | None |
| Vice Principal | 1 | 1 | None |
| Counselor | 1 | 1 | None |
| Nurse | 1 | 1 | None |
| Secretary I | 2.8 | 1.8 | -1 |
| Custodial | 4 | 3 | -1 |
| Media Tech | 2 | 1 | -1 |

Lake schools are already running lean - there's almost nothing left to cut.

### Valley Schools (Pages 8, 12)

Both North and South scenarios cut:
- 1 Principal ($161,942)
- 1 Secretary II ($61,082)
- 1 Secretary I ($41,621)
- 2.5 Custodial ($264,816)
- 1 Media Tech ($58,120)
- 1 Maintenance ($78,189)
- 1 Counselor ($102,923)
- 1 Nurse ($87,074)

Valley consolidations achieve **$938,762** in staff savings vs **$188,013** for lake.

## Questions for the Board

1. **Why doesn't the presentation include revenue impact?** The slides show cost savings but not the Attendance Area funding that would be lost.

2. **Has the district modeled student retention scenarios?** What happens to the budget if 50%, 70%, or 90% of lake families leave?

3. **Why pursue the lowest-savings option?** Lake consolidation saves $251K while North/South each save $1M+.

4. **Are lake schools currently subsidizing valley schools?** The $809K+ net surplus from lake schools flows into the general fund.

5. **What is the long-term enrollment strategy?** Open enrollment (AB 533) could accelerate departures if local schools close.

## Conclusion

The consolidation analysis presented to the board is incomplete. It shows only one side of the ledger (costs) while ignoring the other (revenue).

**Lake schools are not a financial burden - they are a financial asset.**

Closing them doesn't save $251K. It risks losing $2-4M in state funding while eliminating schools that currently contribute $809K+ to the district's general fund.
