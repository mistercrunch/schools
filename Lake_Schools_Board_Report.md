# Financial Impact Analysis: Lake Schools Consolidation
## Douglas County School District Board Report

**Schools Under Review:** Zephyr Cove Elementary School & George Whittell High School
**Data Source:** Nevada PCFP Model 2025-2027 (Final, June 4, 2025)
**Report Date:** December 2025

---

## Executive Summary

This report analyzes the financial implications of potentially closing the two lake schools in the Zephyr Cove attendance area. **The analysis reveals that closure would result in significant, irrecoverable funding losses to Douglas County School District—losses that far exceed any potential operational savings.**

### Key Findings

| Impact Category | Annual Loss | Biennial Loss |
|-----------------|-------------|---------------|
| **Best Case** (100% student retention) | $1.92 million | $3.85 million |
| **Likely Case** (50% retention) | $3.20 million | $6.41 million |
| **Worst Case** (10% retention based on survey) | $4.48 million | $8.96 million |

**Critical Insight:** The worse the student retention rate, the greater the financial loss to the district. Preliminary survey data suggesting only 5-10% of families would transfer to valley schools indicates the district could lose **$4.5 million annually**—nearly 7% of total district funding.

## Section 2: Understanding Nevada's Funding Formula

### 2.1 Pupil-Centered Funding Plan (PCFP) Components

Nevada's PCFP allocates funding through several mechanisms:

| Funding Component | Description | FY2026 Rate/Amount |
|-------------------|-------------|-------------------|
| **Statewide Base Per-Pupil** | Base funding for every student | $9,432 per student |
| **District Size Adjustment** | Additional funding for small/isolated attendance areas | Formula-based |
| **English Learner Weighted** | Additional funding for EL students | $4,244 per EL student |
| **At-Risk Weighted** | Additional funding for at-risk students | $3,301 per at-risk student |
| **Gifted/Talented Weighted** | Additional funding for GATE students | $1,132 per GATE student |
| **Transportation** | Funding for student transportation | District allocation |
| **Special Education** | Local special education funding | District allocation |

### 2.2 The District Size Adjustment Formula

The District Size Adjustment is **the critical factor** in this analysis. Nevada uses a tiered formula that provides progressively higher per-pupil adjustments for smaller attendance areas:

| Enrollment Range | Formula |
|------------------|---------|
| 0-17 students | 25.003 × (enrollment^-0.791) |
| 18-3,899 students | (-0.281 × ln(enrollment)) + 3.4 |
| 3,900+ students | (-0.000001735 × enrollment) + 1.0868 |

**This formula exists specifically to support small, isolated schools that serve essential community needs but cannot achieve economies of scale.**

### 2.3 Douglas County Attendance Areas - Size Adjustment Comparison

| Attendance Area | Enrollment | Size Adj. Factor | Per-Pupil Adj. | Total Adjustment |
|-----------------|------------|------------------|----------------|------------------|
| Gardnerville/Minden | 4,496.1 | 0.0377 | **$745** | $3,350,112 |
| Jacobsen | 21.8 | 1.536 | **$14,474** | $314,915 |
| **Zephyr Cove** | **272.8** | **0.825** | **$7,772** | **$2,119,889** |
| **Douglas Total** | **4,790.6** | — | **$1,208** | **$5,784,916** |

**Key Observation:** Zephyr Cove receives **10.4× more per-pupil adjustment** than Gardnerville/Minden ($7,772 vs. $745). This is not an anomaly—it is the intended function of the formula to support small, geographically isolated schools.

## Section 3: Financial Impact Analysis

### 3.1 Current Lake Schools Funding (FY2026)

| Funding Component | Zephyr Cove Area | Calculation |
|-------------------|------------------|-------------|
| Base Per-Pupil Funding | $2,572,767 | 272.8 × $9,432 |
| District Size Adjustment | $2,119,889 | Formula-based (see 2.2) |
| **Total Direct Funding** | **$4,692,656** | — |

*Note: Weighted funding (EL, At-Risk, GATE) and Transportation are allocated at the district level and would follow students.*

### 3.2 What Happens If Schools Close?

The financial impact depends critically on **what families do** when their local schools close:

#### Scenario Matrix

| If a family... | Base Funding ($9,432/student) | Size Adjustment ($7,772/student) |
|----------------|-------------------------------|----------------------------------|
| Transfers to Gardnerville/Minden | **Retained** (follows student) | **Mostly Lost** (reduced to $745/student) |
| Transfers to South Lake Tahoe (CA) | **Lost** (leaves NV system) | **Lost** |
| Homeschools | **Lost** | **Lost** |
| Moves out of area | **Lost** | **Lost** |
| Enrolls in private school | **Lost** | **Lost** |

## Section 4: Scenario Analysis

### 4.1 Scenario Definitions

Based on community feedback and regional demographics, we model three scenarios:

| Scenario | Valley Transfer Rate | Description |
|----------|---------------------|-------------|
| **A: Best Case** | 100% | All students transfer to Gardnerville/Minden schools |
| **B: Moderate** | 50% | Half transfer to valley; half leave district |
| **C: Survey-Based** | 10% | Based on preliminary community feedback (5-10% would transfer) |

### 4.2 Detailed Scenario Analysis

#### Scenario A: 100% Transfer to Valley Schools (Best Case)

| Component | Current | Post-Closure | Change |
|-----------|---------|--------------|--------|
| Students in district | 272.8 | 272.8 | — |

## Section 5: Context and Comparisons

### 5.1 Comparable Small Attendance Areas in Nevada

Zephyr Cove is not unique—Nevada has many small attendance areas that receive enhanced Size Adjustment funding:

| District | Attendance Area | Enrollment | Per-Pupil Adj. | Total Adj. |
|----------|-----------------|------------|----------------|------------|
| Clark | Goodsprings | 3.0 | $90,196 | $268,088 |
| Clark | Lundy | 1.0 | $223,425 | $227,035 |
| Clark | Searchlight | 10.5 | $27,267 | $286,454 |
| Clark | Sandy Valley | 293.9 | $7,574 | $2,226,102 |
| **Douglas** | **Zephyr Cove** | **272.8** | **$7,772** | **$2,119,889** |
| Elko | Wells | 285.6 | $7,650 | $2,184,930 |
| Elko | Owyhee | 222.8 | $8,308 | $1,851,212 |
| Eureka | Eureka | 271.2 | $7,787 | $2,111,749 |
| Humboldt | Winnemucca | 2,991.9 | $1,556 | $4,655,063 |

**Observation:** Zephyr Cove's per-pupil adjustment is consistent with other small Nevada attendance areas. The funding formula is working as designed.

### 5.2 Zephyr Cove's Disproportionate Contribution

| Metric | Lake Schools | District Total | Lake Schools % |
|--------|--------------|----------------|----------------|
| Enrollment | 272.8 | 4,790.6 | 5.7% |
| Size Adjustment Funding | $2,119,889 | $5,784,916 | **36.6%** |

**The lake schools bring in 36.6% of the district's Size Adjustment funding while serving only 5.7% of students.** This is the intended policy outcome—not a distortion.

### 5.3 Geographic and Community Factors

| Factor | Zephyr Cove | Gardnerville/Minden |
|--------|-------------|---------------------|
| Elevation | ~6,300 ft | ~4,700 ft |
| Distance to valley schools | 25-35 miles | — |
| Winter driving conditions | Severe (Kingsbury Grade) | Moderate |
| State border | Adjacent to California | Interior |
| Alternative schools nearby | South Lake Tahoe (CA) | None |

**Geographic isolation is precisely why the Size Adjustment exists.** These are not schools that can be easily consolidated without significant student attrition.

---

## Section 6: Additional Financial Considerations

### 6.1 Transportation Cost Implications

Current district transportation funding: **$3,977,265** (FY2026)

If lake schools close, students transferring to valley schools would require:
- ~50-70 mile round-trip daily bus routes
- Travel over Kingsbury Grade (7,334 ft elevation)
- Extended bus times (potentially 1+ hour each way)
- Winter weather delays and cancellations

**Transportation costs would increase while overall funding decreases.**

### 6.2 Facility and Operational Costs

Any analysis of "savings" from closure must account for:
- Ongoing facility maintenance costs (buildings don't disappear)
- Potential sale proceeds vs. community asset loss
- Capacity constraints at receiving schools
- One-time closure and transition costs

### 6.3 Long-Term Enrollment Trends

If families leave the district due to school closure:
- Lost students represent **permanent** base funding reduction
- Community population decline affects future enrollment projections
- Property values and tax base may be affected
- Recovery of lost enrollment is historically difficult

---

## Section 7: Recommended Next Steps

### 7.1 Immediate Actions

1. **Conduct Formal Family Survey**
   - Anonymous survey is insufficient for planning
   - Need **binding declarations of intent** from families
   - Survey should include: transfer to valley, homeschool, CA schools, move away, other
   - Results will determine which scenario to plan for

2. **Request NDE Clarification**
   - Confirm Size Adjustment calculation methodology
   - Verify whether any exceptions or phase-outs might apply
   - Understand any hold-harmless provisions

3. **Engage State Legislators**
   - The PCFP Size Adjustment exists to protect schools like Zephyr Cove
   - Legislative intent should be communicated clearly

### 7.2 Analysis Extensions

| Analysis | Purpose |
|----------|---------|
| Transportation cost modeling | Quantify additional costs if students transfer |
| Facility disposition study | Understand options and proceeds for buildings |
| Community economic impact | Assess broader effects on Lake Tahoe area |
| Historical precedent review | Study outcomes of similar closures in Nevada |

### 7.3 Stakeholder Engagement

- Parent/guardian town halls with detailed financial presentation
- Staff impact assessment and communication
- Community leader briefings
- Local government coordination (Tahoe area)

---

## Section 8: Conclusions

### 8.1 Key Takeaways

1. **Closure loses money.** Even in the best-case scenario (100% student retention), Douglas County loses **$1.9 million annually** in Size Adjustment funding.

2. **Realistic scenarios are worse.** Based on preliminary survey data, actual losses could reach **$4.4 million annually**—nearly 7% of district funding.

3. **The formula works as intended.** Nevada's Size Adjustment specifically supports small, isolated schools. Zephyr Cove's enhanced funding is not an anomaly—it is policy working correctly.

4. **Geographic reality matters.** The 25-35 mile distance, mountain pass, and proximity to California schools mean many families will not transfer to valley schools.

5. **Student attrition is the biggest risk.** Every student who leaves the district entirely costs the district $9,432 in base funding PLUS the Size Adjustment differential.

### 8.2 Financial Summary

| Scenario | Students Lost to District | Annual Funding Loss | 5-Year Cumulative Loss |
|----------|--------------------------|--------------------|-----------------------|
| Best Case (100% transfer) | 0 | $1,916,643 | $9,583,215 |
| Moderate (50% transfer) | 136 | $3,304,508 | $16,522,540 |
| Survey-Based (10% transfer) | 246 | $4,414,881 | $22,074,405 |

### 8.3 Bottom Line

**Closing the lake schools would result in a net financial loss to Douglas County School District under every realistic scenario.** The Size Adjustment funding mechanism was designed precisely to prevent the closure of schools like Zephyr Cove Elementary and George Whittell High School.

Before any consolidation decision is made, the Board should:
1. Obtain reliable data on family intentions
2. Model the full financial impact including transportation
3. Consider the legislative intent behind small-school funding
4. Evaluate the long-term community and enrollment effects

## Appendix B: Size Adjustment Formula Detail

The Nevada PCFP uses the following formula for District Size Adjustment:

**For attendance areas with 18-3,899 students:**
```
Adjustment Factor = (-0.281 × ln(enrollment)) + 3.4
Per-Pupil Adjustment = Adjustment Factor × Statewide Base ($9,432)
```

**Zephyr Cove calculation:**
```
ln(272.77) = 5.609
Adjustment Factor = (-0.281 × 5.609) + 3.4 = 1.824
Per-Pupil Adjustment = 1.824 × $9,432 = $7,772 (rounded: factor × base ≈ 0.824 of base)
```
